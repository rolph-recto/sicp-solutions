## Solutions to Chapter 1.1

#### 1.4 

This procedure returns the sum of `a` and the absolute value of `b`.

#### 1.5
If the language is lazy ("normal order"), `(test 0 (p))` will return 0.

If the language is strict ("applicative order"), `(test 0 (p))` will run forever / diverge.

#### 1.6
`sqrt-iter` using `new-if` will run forever / diverge because
`new-if` always evaluates both branches of the conditional,
regardless of whether or not the branch's value will return.
If `new-if` is defined as a [lazy function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fexpr), this would not be a problem.

#### 1.7

```lisp
(define (sqrt x)
  (define (good-enough? old_guess guess)
    (< (abs (- guess old_guess)) 0.001))
  (define (improve guess) (average guess (/ x guess)))
  (define (sqrt-iter old_guess guess x)
    (if (good-enough? old_guess guess)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter guess (improve guess))))

  (sqrt-iter (/ x 2) (improve (/ x 2)) x))
```
